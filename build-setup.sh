##
# Setup the builder locally for multi-arch images support.
#
# Before building with multi-arch support, a builder needs to be configured locally. This script
# will run the required commands for the builder to be ready to prepare the multi-arch images.
#
# Usage:
#
#  ./build-setup.sh
#

# Ensure QEMU is installed and configured:

docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all

# Create a new builder instance to enable multi-architecture builds

docker buildx create --name multiarch-builder --use

# Verify the builder is active

docker buildx ls
